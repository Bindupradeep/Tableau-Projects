# Tableau-Projects

I have done two projects for Data Visualizations on Tableau.
1. Foreign Direct Investment (FDI) Visualization.
2. Customer Purchase Analysis.

**Foreign Direct Investment (FDI)**

A **Foreign Direct Investment (FDI)** is a purchase of an interest in a company by a company or an investor located outside its borders. Generally, the term is used to describe a business decision to acquire a substantial stake in a foreign business or to buy it outright in order to expand its operations to a new region.
The investment may involve acquiring a source of materials, expanding a company's footprint, or developing a multinational presence.

The dataset can be dowloaded from this link: https://www.kaggle.com/rajanand/fdi-in-india.
The dataset contains data from the year 2000 until 2016.

**Customer Purchase Analysis**

This is the dataset containing information about the purchases made by people. The dataset contains info about the items purchased, mode of payment, personal details like name, phone number, email address, etc. I have done a descriptive analysis of the data on Tableau.
